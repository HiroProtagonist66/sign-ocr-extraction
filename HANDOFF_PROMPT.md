# Handoff Prompt for Next Claude Chat

## Copy this entire prompt to start a new chat:

I'm continuing work on the sign-ocr-extraction project. Please review:
1. `/CLAUDE.md` - Main project documentation (UPDATED Sept 1 Night)
2. `/chat_summaries/SESSION_2025-09-01_NIGHT_MANAGER_OVERHAUL.md` - Latest session

## Current Project State (September 1, 2025 - Night)

### What's Working:
✅ **Manager Page** - Complete three-panel sign type assignment system
✅ **Mobile Touch** - v2.4 with dynamic MIN_ZOOM working perfectly
✅ **PDF Processing** - Server-side API route operational
✅ **Mock Data** - 4,314 ATL06 signs ready for assignment
✅ **Bulk Operations** - Auto-assign, multi-select, export all functional

### Live URLs:
- Manager: https://sign-ocr-extraction.vercel.app/manager
- Field: https://sign-ocr-extraction.vercel.app/fieldv2
- Validation: https://sign-ocr-extraction.vercel.app/validation

### Database Status:
- Supabase client installed and configured
- Schema defined in `/lib/supabase.ts`
- Mock data fallback working (4,314 signs)
- **NEEDS**: Production credentials in environment variables

## Priority Tasks:

### 1. Connect Production Supabase
```bash
# Add to .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=actual_url_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=actual_key_here
```

### 2. Process Real ATL06 PDF
- Upload `/public/data/atl06/release.pdf` (57 pages)
- Test PDF extraction with real sign types
- Verify page-to-sign mapping accuracy

### 3. Implement Verification Workflow
- Add "Mark as Verified" button for reviewed assignments
- Track who verified and when
- Show verification progress separately

### 4. Add Pattern-Based Assignment
```typescript
// Assign signs by pattern
assignByPattern(/^2\d{3}/, 'BC-1.0'); // All 2000-series to BC-1.0
assignByPattern(/\.1$/, 'SPLIT');      // All .1 variants
```

### 5. Create Import Function
- Load previous assignments from JSON
- Merge with existing data
- Handle conflicts gracefully

## Known Issues to Address:

1. **PDF Worker**: Using empty worker string - consider local worker file
2. **Performance**: Virtual scroll only shows 100 signs - add pagination
3. **Validation**: No duplicate sign number checking yet
4. **Mobile**: Manager page not optimized for tablets yet

## Architecture Overview:

```
Manager Page (Three Panels)
├── PDF Navigator (Left)
│   ├── Page preview
│   ├── Sign type detection
│   └── Auto-assign button
├── Sign List (Middle)
│   ├── Search/filter
│   ├── Multi-select
│   └── Bulk actions
└── Sign Types (Right)
    ├── Type catalog
    ├── Assignment counts
    └── Quick select

Database Flow:
Supabase → project_sign_catalog → sign_descriptions
         ↓                      ↓
    [4,314 signs]        [10 sign types]
         ↓
    Assignments Map → Export JSON → Field Workers
```

## Recent Git History:
- `77e2494`: Complete manager page overhaul
- `12e3c2d`: Fix PDF.js worker with CDN URL
- `119086f`: Fix Next.js 15 SSR error
- `5820d9f`: Dynamic MIN_ZOOM implementation

## Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Upload test PDF and verify extraction
- [ ] Assign 100 signs and export
- [ ] Import assignments back
- [ ] Test with real Supabase data
- [ ] Verify on tablet device

## Session Context:
This session transformed the manager page from basic CSV upload to a complete sign type assignment system. The three-panel interface handles 4,314 signs efficiently with bulk operations. PDF processing moved server-side to avoid CDN issues. Ready for production Supabase connection.

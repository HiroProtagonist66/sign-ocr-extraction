# Sign OCR Extraction - Session Summary Report
**Date:** August 30, 2025
**Project:** Sign OCR Extraction System for Architectural Floor Plans

## Executive Summary
This session focused on improving the accuracy of sign detection and extraction from architectural floor plans, specifically addressing coordinate accuracy issues and implementing a new color-based detection approach. The system needs to scale to handle 13,000+ signs across 7 projects.

## Problem Statement
- Initial OCR extraction had incorrect coordinates (signs appearing in wrong positions)
- Manual calibration was not scalable for 13,000+ signs
- Need for automated, accurate sign detection and positioning

## Session Progress

### 1. Initial Coordinate Issues
**Problem:** Sign hotspots were misaligned on the floor plan visualization
- Sign "2001" OCR coordinates: (30%, 48%)
- Actual position: (~35%, ~27%)
- All 157 signs had systematic positioning errors

**Initial Attempts:**
- Manual calibration for individual signs (not scalable)
- CSS positioning adjustments
- Transform calculations using translate(-50%, -50%)

### 2. Automated Coordinate Correction
**Solution Implemented:**
- Created `fix-coordinates.js` script
- Applied linear transformation: x-scale: 1.17x, y-scale: 0.65x
- Fixed all 157 signs automatically
- Generated `fixed_coordinates.json`

**Results:**
- Improved positioning but still not perfectly accurate
- Revealed that OCR coordinates were fundamentally incorrect

### 3. Color-Based Detection Pipeline
**New Approach:** Target the actual orange/brown sign boxes using computer vision

**Implementation:**
```python
# Key Components
- PDF to high-res image conversion (400 DPI)
- HSV color space detection
- Morphological operations for cleanup
- Contour detection and filtering
- OCR with number-only whitelist
```

**Color Ranges:**
```python
HSV_LOWER_BOUND = np.array([8, 80, 80])
HSV_UPPER_BOUND = np.array([25, 255, 220])
```

**Pipeline Features:**
- Detects orange/brown colored boxes
- Filters by size and aspect ratio
- Preprocesses for OCR (denoise, contrast enhancement)
- Generates visualization with green box overlays
- Outputs JSON with percentage-based coordinates

### 4. Current Results
**Detection Performance:**
- ✅ 99 color boxes successfully detected
- ✅ Visualization shows green outlines on detected boxes
- ⚠️ OCR extraction needs tuning (0 signs extracted from boxes)
- ⚠️ Missing some boxes with blue/teal outlines
- ⚠️ Stacked boxes counted as single units

### 5. Web Application Integration
**Features Added:**
- New `/plans/color-extraction` page
- Pan and zoom functionality
- Toggle between original and detection views
- Real-time statistics display
- Interactive controls (drag, scroll, zoom buttons)

**Deployment:**
- Live at: https://sign-ocr-extraction.vercel.app
- All extraction methods viewable in one place
- Navigation grid on homepage

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV (Python)
- **OCR:** Tesseract with pytesseract wrapper
- **PDF Processing:** pdf2image with Poppler
- **Image Processing:** 400 DPI resolution, HSV color space
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## Key Files Created/Modified

### Python Scripts
- `extraction/color_based_extraction.py` - Main detection pipeline
- `extraction/run_from_image.py` - PNG processing script
- `extraction/tune_colors.py` - Interactive HSV tuning utility
- `extraction/requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

### Web Application
- `app/plans/color-extraction/page.tsx` - Color extraction viewer
- `app/plans/calibrated/page.tsx` - Calibrated positions view
- `app/page.tsx` - Updated homepage with navigation

### Data Files
- `test_data/extraction_results/fixed_coordinates.json` - Corrected positions
- `public/extraction/detected_signs.jpg` - Visualization output
- `public/extraction/image_extraction_results.json` - Detection results

## Outstanding Issues

### Detection Gaps
1. **Multiple outline colors:** Some boxes have blue or teal outlines instead of green
2. **Stacked boxes:** Multiple signs stacked vertically counted as one
3. **OCR failure:** Text extraction from detected boxes not working

### Proposed Solutions
1. **Expand color detection:**
   - Add HSV ranges for blue outlines: H(100-130)
   - Add HSV ranges for teal outlines: H(160-190)
   - Combine multiple masks with OR operation

2. **Stack detection algorithm:**
   ```python
   # If box height > standard_height * 1.5:
   #   count = round(height / standard_height)
   #   split into multiple detections
   ```

3. **OCR improvements:**
   - Try different PSM modes (6, 8, 11)
   - Adjust preprocessing (adaptive threshold)
   - Consider template matching for numbers

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Update HSV ranges to detect all outline colors
2. Implement stacked box detection logic
3. Tune OCR parameters for better extraction
4. Test with different floor plan pages

### Medium-term Goals
1. Process all 7 projects with refined pipeline
2. Build confidence scoring system
3. Implement manual correction interface
4. Create batch processing capabilities

### Long-term Vision
1. Machine learning model for sign detection
2. Auto-learning from corrections
3. API service for sign extraction
4. Integration with CAD systems

## Success Metrics
- **Current:** 99/157 boxes detected (63%)
- **Target:** 150+/157 boxes detected (95%+)
- **OCR Success:** 0% → Target 90%+
- **Processing Speed:** ~10 seconds per page
- **Scalability:** Ready for 13,000+ signs

## Lessons Learned
1. **OCR coordinates unreliable:** Original text detection positions don't match visual locations
2. **Color detection effective:** Targeting visual characteristics more accurate than text position
3. **Multiple detection methods needed:** Combination of approaches required for comprehensive coverage
4. **Visualization critical:** Visual debugging essential for accuracy verification
5. **Iterative refinement:** Each method improvement reveals new edge cases

## Session Conclusion

Primary remaining challenge is OCR extraction from detected boxes and expanding detection to cover all outline color variants.
